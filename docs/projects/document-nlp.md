# Area 2: Text Processing

We use NLP and other techniques to go through scanned text and other material in corporate reports and other reports to get "key items." This data can be linked with other computer-based information to take necessary follow-up actions.

NLP: we have implemented methods for preprocessing documents in an NLP context. We use NLTK to perform tasks such as frequency dictionaries and named entity recognition. We plan on trying new models and continuing to read documents to gain further insights into what information can be gained from each section.â€‹

Preprocessing: we convert PDFs (machine readable or scanned) to text and separate them into sections for analysis.

Mainly based on data from Malaysian Bank
