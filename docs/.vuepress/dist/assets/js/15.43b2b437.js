The pre-processing pipeline we are designing begins with determining the type of document, which is done by identifying the major features of each document. From here, the document undergoes a specific preprocessing routine depending on what type of noise could be located on the document (for example, slanted text, scan grain, and watermarks) in order to prepare it for OCR. This process can be improved by implementing a feature extractor and then processing the images by individual clusters instead of via one single pipeline for the entire image. It can be further improved with the implementation of reinforcement learning so as to boost the decision-making ability for pre-processing each document type. This in turn, will yield the best results when applying OCR on the documents. Subsequent to optical recognition stage, we are using natural language processing to identify desired information (e.g. Identify a shareholder’s name and their position in the company). From this, we can generate a structured table that contains the information extracted.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
